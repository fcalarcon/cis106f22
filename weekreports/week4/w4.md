## Key Terms

*Definitions of the following terms*

* **File system**: the way the files are stored and organized to simplify access to data.
* **Current directory**: the directory you are at the moment 
* **parent directory**: backwards to the previous directory
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory**
  * your home directory is your current working directory when you open a terminal emulator. Every user in system has a home directory and full permissions of their own. The home directory is accessed through root user only.
* **pathname**: indicates the location of the file in the filesystem (like an address)
* **relative path**: the location of a file stating from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory
* **absolute path**: the location of a file starting at the root of the file system
* **The commands are used for navigating the filesystem**
  * pwd
  * cd
  * ls
